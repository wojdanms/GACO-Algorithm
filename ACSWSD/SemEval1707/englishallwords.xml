<head id="d00.s01.t02">implied</head>
we
had
<head id="d00.s01.t06">discovered</head>
that
the
principal
<head id="d00.s01.t11">cause</head>
of
homelessness
is
to
be
<head id="d00.s01.t19">find</head>
in
the
large
numbers
of
mentally
ill
and
substance-abusing
people
in
the
homeless
population
.
We
have
<head id="d00.s02.t02">made</head>
no
such
<head id="d00.s02.t05">statement</head>
.
It
is
clear
that
most
mentally
ill
people
and
most
alcoholics
do
not
<head id="d00.s03.t14">become</head>
homeless
.
The
<head id="d00.s04.t02">causes</head>
of
homelessness
are
poorly
<head id="d00.s04.t08">understood</head>
and
complex
in
any
individual
case
.
In
*
<head id="d00.s05.t02">quoting</head>
from
our
research
you
<head id="d00.s05.t07">emphasized</head>
the
high
prevalence
of
mental
illness
and
alcoholism
.
You
did
not
<head id="d00.s06.t03">note</head>
that
the
homeless
<head id="d00.s06.t07">people</head>
we
<head id="d00.s06.t10">examined</head>
<head id="d00.s06.t12">had</head>
a
<head id="d00.s06.t14">multitude</head>
of
physical
disorders
in
addition
to
their
psychiatric
problems
and
substance_abuse
.
They
<head id="d00.s07.t01">suffered</head>
from
malnutrition
,
chest

,

and

Homeless
<head id="d00.s08.t01">people</head>
not
only
<head id="d00.s08.t04">lack</head>
safety
,
privacy
and
<head id="d00.s08.t09">shelter</head>
,
they
also
<head id="d00.s08.t13">lack</head>
the
elementary
<head id="d00.s08.t16">necessities</head>
of
nutrition
,
cleanliness
and
basic
health_care
.
In
a
recent
report
,
the
Institute
of
Medicine
<head id="d00.s09.t09" sats="d00.s09.t09">pointed_out</head>
that
certain
health
<head id="d00.s09.t14">problems</head>
may
<head id="d00.s09.t16">predispose</head>
a
<head id="d00.s09.t18">person</head>
to
homelessness
,
others
may
be
a
consequence
of
it
,
and
a
third
<head id="d00.s09.t33">category</head>
is
<head id="d00.s09.t35">composed</head>
of
disorders
whose
treatment
is
difficult
or
impossible
if
a
person
<head id="d00.s09.t49">lacks</head>
adequate
<head id="d00.s09.t51">shelter</head>
.
The
<head id="d00.s10.t01">interactions</head>
between
health
and
homelessness
are
complex
,
<head id="d00.s10.t10">defying</head>
sweeping
<head id="d00.s10.t12">generalizations</head>
as
to
cause
or
effect
.
If
we
<head id="d00.s11.t02" sats="d00.s11.t02">look_to</head>
the
future
,
*
<head id="d00.s11.t08">preventing</head>
homelessness
is
an
important
objective
.
This
will
<head id="d00.s12.t02">require</head>
us
to
<head id="d00.s12.t05">develop</head>
a
much
more
sophisticated
<head id="d00.s12.t10">understanding</head>
of
the
dynamics
of
homelessness
than
we
currently
<head id="d00.s12.t19">possess</head>
,
an
understanding
that
can
be
<head id="d00.s12.t28">developed</head>
only
through
careful
study
and
research

A
<head id="d00.s14.t01">study</head>
by
Tulane
Prof.
James
Wright
<head id="d00.s14.t07">says</head>
homelessness
is
due
to
a
complex
array
of
problems
,
with
the
common
thread
of
poverty
.
The
<head id="d00.s15.t01">study</head>
<head id="d00.s15.t02">shows</head>
that
nearly
of
the
homeless
population
is
<head id="d00.s15.t12" sats="d00.s15.t12">made_up</head>
of
women
and
children
and
that
only
of
the
homeless
<head id="d00.s15.t27">exhibits</head>
some
<head id="d00.s15.t29">combination</head>
of
drug
,
alcohol
and
mental
problems
.
According
to
Dr.
Wright
,
homelessness
is
simultaneously
a
housing
<head id="d00.s16.t11">problem</head>
,
an
employment
problem
,
a
demographic
problem
,
a
problem
of
social
disaffiliation
,
a
mental
health
problem
,
a
family
violence
problem
,
a
problem
<head id="d00.s16.t39">created</head>
*
by
the
cutbacks
in
social
welfare
spending
,
a
problem
<head id="d00.s16.t51">resulting</head>
from
the
decay
of
the
traditional
nuclear
family
,
and
a
problem
intimately
<head id="d00.s16.t65">connected</head>
to
the
recent
increase
in
the
number
of
<head id="d00.s16.t74">persons</head>
<head id="d00.s16.t75">living</head>

If
you
're
homeless
,
you
do
not
<head id="d00.s18.t29">sleep</head>
for
fear
of
*
being
<head id="d00.s18.t35">robbed</head>
or
murdered
.
After
your
first
three
weeks
of
sleep
deprivation
,
you
're
scarcely
in
touch
with
reality
any
more
;
without
psychiatric
treatment
,
you
may
well
be
unable
to
<head id="d00.s19.t30">fend</head>
for
yourself
ever
again
.
Some
of
the
homeless
,
obviously
,
<head id="d00.s20.t07">had</head>
pre-existing
mental
illness
or
<head id="d00.s20.t12">addiction</head>
.
But
many
others
have
<head id="d00.s21.t04">fallen</head>
through
cracks
in
the
economy
into
the
grim
,
brutal
world
of
our
city
streets
.
Once
there
,
what
ways
of
escape
are
open
to
them
other
than
drink
,
drugs

You
<head id="d00.s24.t01">dismiss</head>
as
sentimental
the
<head id="d00.s24.t07">view</head>
that
the
<head id="d00.s24.t10">reduction</head>
of
federal
housing-assistance
programs
by
might
have
<head id="d00.s24.t20">played</head>
a
significant
<head id="d00.s24.t23">role</head>
in
the
increased
<head id="d00.s24.t27">number</head>
of
men
and
<head id="d00.s24.t31">women</head>
sleeping
on
our
city
streets
during
the
Reagan-Bush
years
.
There
is
no
sign
that
you
<head id="d00.s25.t06">bothered</head>
to
<head id="d00.s25.t09">consider</head>
the
inverse
of
your
logic
:
namely
,
that
mental
illness
and
substance
abuse
might
be
to
some
degree
consequences
rather
than
causes
of
homelessness
.
Your
<head id="d00.s26.t01">research</head>

you
<head id="d00.s28.t16">chose</head>
to

as
the

Association

Allied
Craftsmen
,
<head id="d00.s28.t40">insinuating</head>
that
the
march
<head id="d00.s28.t44">got</head>
its
major
<head id="d00.s28.t47">support</head>
from
self-serving
groups
that
<head id="d00.s28.t54">know</head>
a
good
<head id="d00.s28.t57">thing</head>
when
they
<head id="d00.s28.t60">see</head>
it
,
and
that
the
<head id="d00.s28.t68">crusade</head>
was
<head id="d00.s28.t70">based</head>
on
greed
or
the
profit
motive

But
is
not
the
desire
for
profit
the
driving
<head id="d00.s29.t09">force</head>
behind
those
who
<head id="d00.s29.t14">subscribe</head>
to
,
and

in

not

the

of
their
homes

I
would
<head id="d00.s33.t02">predict</head>
that
within
a
short
time
most
of
them
would
<head id="d00.s33.t12">find</head>
Thunderbird

satisfactory
substitute
for
Chivas

that
their

<head id="d02.s27.t03">lots</head>
of
coffee
drinking
while

stretches

ground
activity
<head id="d02.s29.t08">came</head>
or
so
lovely
<head id="d02.s29.t13">minute</head>

down

into

canal

*
<head id="d02.s34.t01">See</head>
,
the
other
rule

that

neither

seldom

higher
than

and
most
<head id="d02.s38.t10">average</head>

in
a
picnic
basket
.
What
's
he
<head id="d02.s41.t04">doing</head>
?
<head id="d02.s41.t08">hissed</head>
my
<head id="d02.s41.t11">companion</head>
,
who
was
the
only
other
English-speaking
member
of
the
convention
and
whose
knuckles
were
white
.
Attention
,
<head id="d02.s42.t04">yelled</head>
our
<head id="d02.s42.t07">pilot</head>
as
our
<head id="d02.s42.t10">basket</head>
<head id="d02.s42.t11">plunged</head>
into
the
canal
.
You
bet
attention
,
I
<head id="d02.s43.t07">yelled</head>
back
,
<head id="d02.s43.t12">leaping</head>
atop
the
propane
tanks
,
I
'm
<head id="d02.s43.t21">wearing</head>
alligator
<head id="d02.s43.t23">loafers</head>
.
Our
<head id="d02.s44.t01">pilot</head>
simply
<head id="d02.s44.t03">laughed</head>
,
<head id="d02.s44.t05">fired</head>
up
the
<head id="d02.s44.t08">burner</head>
and
with
another
blast
of
flame
<head id="d02.s44.t15">lifted</head>
us
,
oh
,
a
good
above
the
water
level
.
We
<head id="d02.s45.t01">scuttled</head>
along
for
a
few
feet
before
he
<head id="d02.s45.t09">plunged</head>
us
into
the
drink
again
.
Eventually
we
<head id="d02.s46.t02">came</head>
to
<head id="d02.s46.t05">rest</head>
in
a
soggy
patch
of
field
where
we
<head id="d02.s46.t14">had</head>
the
exquisite
<head id="d02.s46.t17">pleasure</head>
of
*
<head id="d02.s46.t20">scrambling</head>
out
of
the
basket
into
the
mud
while
the
French
<head id="d02.s46.t31">half</head>
of
our
ballooning
tag
team
<head id="d02.s46.t37">scrambled</head>
in
.
I
<head id="d02.s47.t01">looked</head>
at
my
watch
.
Barely
half-an-hour
aloft
.
Back
in
the
chase
car
,
we
<head id="d02.s49.t07">drove</head>
around
some
more
,
<head id="d02.s49.t12">got</head>
<head id="d02.s49.t13" sats="d02.s49.t13">stuck_in</head>
a
ditch
,
<head id="d02.s49.t19">enlisted</head>
the
<head id="d02.s49.t21">aid</head>
of
a
local
<head id="d02.s49.t25">farmer</head>
to
<head id="d02.s49.t29" sats="d02.s49.t29">get_out</head>
the
trailer
<head id="d02.s49.t33">hitch</head>
and
<head id="d02.s49.t35" sats="d02.s49.t35">pull_out</head>
us
of
the
ditch
.
We
finally
<head id="d02.s50.t02">rendezvoused</head>
with
our
<head id="d02.s50.t05">balloon</head>
,
which
had
<head id="d02.s50.t10">come</head>
to
<head id="d02.s50.t13">rest</head>
on
a
dirt
road
amid
a
clutch
of
Epinalers
who
<head id="d02.s50.t25">watched</head>
us
<head id="d02.s50.t27">disassemble</head>
our
<head id="d02.s50.t29">craft</head>
another
half-an-hour
of
non-flight
<head id="d02.s50.t35">activity</head>
that
<head id="d02.s50.t39">included</head>
the
precision
<head id="d02.s50.t42">routine</head>
of
*
<head id="d02.s50.t45">yanking</head>
the
balloon
to
the
ground
,
<head id="d02.s50.t52">punching</head>
all
the
<head id="d02.s50.t55">air</head>
out
of
it
,
<head id="d02.s50.t60" sats="d02.s50.t60">rolling_up</head>
it
and
<head id="d02.s50.t64">cramming</head>
it
and
the
<head id="d02.s50.t68">basket</head>
into
the
trailer
.
It
was
the
most
<head id="d02.s51.t04">exercise</head>
we
'd
<head id="d02.s51.t08">had</head>
all
morning
and
it
was
<head id="d02.s51.t15">followed</head>
by
our
<head id="d02.s51.t19">drive</head>
immediately
to
the
nearest
watering
hole
.
This
<head id="d02.s52.t01">meant</head>
*
<head id="d02.s52.t03">returning</head>
to
the
golf
course
,
where
we
<head id="d02.s52.t11">watched</head>
a
few
French
<head id="d02.s52.t15">duffers</head>
<head id="d02.s52.t16">maul</head>
the
first
<head id="d02.s52.t19">tee</head>
while
we
<head id="d02.s52.t22">sat</head>
under
Cinzano
umbrellas
,
me
<head id="d02.s52.t28">nursing</head>
an
espresso
and
my
<head id="d02.s52.t33">ego</head>
.
A
whole
morning
of
ballooning
and
I
had
been
off
the
ground
barely
minutes
.
Still
,
I
<head id="d02.s54.t03">figured</head>
the
event
's
envy-quotient
back
in
the
U.S.A.
was
near
peerless
.
As
for
the
ride
back
to
camp
,
our
pilot
and
all
the
other
French-speaking
passengers
<head id="d02.s55.t16">clambered</head>
into
the
chase
car
.
My
American
companion
and
I
were
<head id="d02.s56.t06">left</head>
to
<head id="d02.s56.t09">ride</head>
alfresco
in
the
wicker
basket
.
As
we
<head id="d02.s57.t02">streaked</head>
by
a
blase
gendarme
,
I
could
not
<head id="d02.s57.t11">resist</head>
<head id="d02.s57.t13">rearing</head>
up
on
my
soggy
loafers
and
<head id="d02.s57.t20">saluting</head>
.
